# SFML2.5Game-Framework
GameFramework with c++

Framework for a multi scene game with SFML and c++

This project has two goals. First is to learn SFML and C++, the second is to create a framework 
that can be saved as a template in Visual Studio ( using Community 2022).  I used the PANG game 
articles by Mathilde E. on medium.com as a basis. It was beyond my knowledge of C++, so to 
learn C++, I started over with the articles as a guide.

I am a retired hobbist with about 5 years of C and assembly language programming from the 
early 1990's. I then went into managment and did not keep up with programming. I started 
back as a hobby about a year ago.

The repository will be used for version control during development.
